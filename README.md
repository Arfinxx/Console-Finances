# Console-Finances

## Description 

In this Challenge, i was given an array of data including months and profit/loss values for those months. I was able to use JavaScript to successfully analyse the financial records and calulcate various things from the data set.

This allowed me to develop my understanding of Javascript Objects, for loops and nested arrays. I mainly referred to the W3 Schools documentation (https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) to learn more about these javaScript features.

The Deployed project can be viewed using this link and inspecting the console:
